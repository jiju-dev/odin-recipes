    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

    <p>This Norwegian Rhubarb and Almond Cake is a delicate breakfast cake that features the unusual 
    combination of tart rhubarb with almond. This is an ideal spring brunch cake. This lovely breakfast 
    cake hails from Norway where rhubarb thrives in the chilly climate. Rhubarb is perennial, prolific, 
    and one of the first crops of spring, making it a beloved ingredient anywhere it grows. 
    (It grows all across the northern half of the US, but the rest of you can find it in your produce aisle.) 
    Rhubarb’s tart berry-like flavor marries beautifully with almond and makes an especially delicious 
    coffee cake for this time of year.</p>

    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 Tbsp unsalted butter at room temperature</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup whole milk or half and half</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp almond extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chopped rhubarb or about 3-5 stalks, depending on size.</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp raw sugar</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp sliced almonds</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>STEPS</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350F</li>
        <li>Lightly grease an 9 inch springform pan and place a round of parchment paper at the bottom.</li>
        <li>Cream the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer or with electric mixers until light 
        and fluffy. This will take a couple of minutes. Don’t skip this step, the creaming incorporates air 
        into the batter that helps the cake bake up light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add in the eggs one at a time, beating the mixture between each addition until they are fully incorporated.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, baking powder, and then the milk or half and half, along with the almond extract. Mix until combined.</li>
        <li>Spread the batter into your prepared pan, making sure it is relatively even.</li>
        <li>Scatter the chopped rhubarb over the top of the cake, pressing it in just a little bit.</li>
        <li>Scatter the raw sugar and sliced almonds over the cake</li>
        <li>Bake for about 30-40 minutes, until set in the middle, and golden brown on top. Let the cake cool for about 
        10 minutes before carefully unlatching the pan.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>NOTES</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Buttermilk can be used instead of milk.</li>
            <li>Try raspberries or blueberries in place of the rhubarb.</li>
            <li>Substitute vanilla extract for the almond extract</li>
        </ul>

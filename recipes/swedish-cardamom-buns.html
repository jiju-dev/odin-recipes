        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

        <p>Swedish Cardamom Buns represent a cherished culinary tradition in Scandinavia, offering soft, pillowy 
        sweet rolls infused with a delightful cardamom sugar filling. These intricately knotted pastries are both 
        delectable and remarkably simple to prepare.</p>

        <p>A SWEET 'FIKA' TRADITION IN NORDIC CULTURE</p>
        
        <p>In Nordic countries, particularly Sweden, the concept of 'fika' embodies the social ritual of taking 
        a coffee break. Similar to the British tradition of afternoon tea, 'fika' is a cherished moment of 
        relaxation and connection. Swedish Cardamom Buns serve as an essential component of this tradition, 
        offering a rejuvenating indulgence. (In Finland, a loaf variation known as 'pulla' is enjoyed.) Much like 
        cinnamon rolls in the United States, these cardamom-infused buns are easy to make and boast a uniquely 
        delicious flavor profile, especially when paired with a delicate vanilla glaze.</p>
            
        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>

            <h4>FOR THE DOUGH</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup plus 2 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
                <li>2 cups plus 2 Tbsp whole milk</li>
                <li>2 packages instant yeast 
                (2 packages contain 1/2 oz. or 4 1/2 teaspoons of yeast.)</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>5 3/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>FOR THE FILLING</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>10 Tbsp unsalted butter, softened</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 Tbsp ground cardamom</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>FOR THE GLAZE</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>STEPS</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a small saucepan, melt the butter and then add the milk. Warm the mixture 
                    until it's lukewarm, and then add it to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the 
                    dough hook attachment. <strong><em>Note: the milk should not be hot, just barely warm to the 
                    touch, or it will kill the yeast.</em></strong></li>
                    <li>Add the yeast to the bowl with the milk and butter mixture, and mix to dissolve. Then 
                    add the salt and sugar, and mix together.</li>
                    <li>With the mixer running on low speed, slowly add the flour. Once all the flour has been 
                    added, continue to knead for about 10 minutes. The dough should be smooth and pulling away 
                    from the side of the bowl.</li>
                    <li>Cover the bowl (no need to transfer to a separate greased bowl) and allow to rise for 
                    45 minutes to an hour, or until about doubled in size. <strong><em>Note: find a nice warm spot for your 
                    dough to rise.</em></strong></li>
                    <li>While the dough is rising, make the cardamom filling by simply mixing all of the filling ingredients 
                    together with a fork until uniform. Your butter should be soft enough to mix easily. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Prepare two large baking sheets by covering them with a sheet of parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>Once the dough is risen, gently deflate it and divide it in half. Place one half on a lightly floured 
                    surface and roll it out into a rectangle about 14 inches wide by 18 inches long. Spread 1/2 of the filling 
                    over 1/2 of the rolled out rectangle.</li>
                    <li>Fold the half of the dough without any filling over the other half of the dough. Roll out the dough a 
                    little bit more to get everything of a fairly even thickness.</li>
                    <li>Using a knife or a pizza cutter, divide your folded rectangle, widthwise, into 8 equal strips.</li>
                    <li>Take each strip and slice it lengthwise almost all the way in half, leaving a little bit 
                    connected at the top.</li>
                    <li>Take each "leg" and gently twist it, both in the same direction.</li>
                    <li>Next, twist the two "legs" around each other gently.</li>
                    <li>Coil your twist into a small circle, tucking the end underneath and pinching it into place so it 
                    doesn't come undone. Don't worry about being perfect, just get it all twisted into a 'messy bun'.</li>
                    <li>Repeat for the rest of your rectangles, and for the other half of the dough.</li>
                    <li>Place your shaped rolls on your prepared baking sheets, spacing them a few inches apart. Cover 
                    loosely with a kitchen towel, and allow to rise again for about 1 hour. They may not puff up very 
                    dramatically, but should be a bit plumper.</li>
                    <li>Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 425F.</li>
                    <li>When the buns are done rising, bake them for 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Make the glaze by adding the sugar and water to a small saucepan and heating just until the 
                    sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
                    <li>When the buns are done baking, remove them from the oven and brush them with the glaze while 
                    still warm. You can add a second coat of the glaze once they have cooled down a bit if you want 
                    them to be extra-shiny.</li>
                </ol>

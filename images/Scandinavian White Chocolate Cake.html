        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

        <p>Kladdkaka, a gooey white chocolate cake originating from Scandinavia, is a staple in every café across 
        Sweden, often outselling other cakes by a considerable margin. There's an undeniable allure to its slightly 
        underbaked, chocolatey texture that captivates the senses. Achieving the perfect baking time may require some 
        experimentation, but a general rule of thumb is to trust your instincts—if you feel it could use a few more 
        minutes, it's best to remove it from the oven at that moment.</p>

        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 sticks butter</li>
                <li>5 oz. good-quality white chocolate (or milk/semisweet or dark/bittersweet chocolate) broken into pieces</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup caster/granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup plain/all purpose flour or cake flour</li>
                <li>a pinch of salt</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla sugar OR extract OR use the seeds from 1 vanilla pod/bean</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>STEPS</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Firstly, preheat the oven to 350°F</li>
                <li>Next, melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat. Remove from the heat and stir in the white chocolate 
                pieces until melted. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Beat together the eggs and caster/granulated sugar until pale and fluffy. Use a stand mixer or a 
                hand-held electric whisk.</li>
                <li>Sift the dry ingredients into a separate bowl and fold gently into the egg and sugar mixture. Fold in 
                the lemon zest and chocolate-butter until combined.</li>
                <li>Pour into the prepared cake pan (23-cm/9-inch springform/springclip round cake pan, greased and lined 
                with baking parchment). Place in the preheated oven immediately. Bake for about 15–17 minutes until the cake 
                is just underbaked. The middle should still be really sticky and only the side should be fully baked. Keep 
                an eye on it, as baking times will vary. If it wobbles, it still needs a little more time in the oven. 
                A skewer inserted 2 cm/3/4 inch from the edge should come out clean.</li>
                <li>Leave the cake to cool completely in the pan for at least an hour before transferring to a serving plate. 
                If you think you have overbaked it, then remove from tin immediately to stop baking process.</li>
            </ol>
